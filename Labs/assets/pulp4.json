4.      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - MORNING                     4.

        Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
        dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
        looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

        We TRACK alongside.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's her name?

                                  JULES
                       Mia.

                                  VINCENT
                       How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                  JULES
                       I dunno, however people meet
                       people.  She usta be an actress.

                                  VINCENT
                       She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                  JULES
                       I think her biggest deal was she
                       starred in a pilot.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's a pilot?

                                  JULES
                       Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                  VINCENT
                       I don't watch TV.

                                  JULES
                       Yes, but you're aware that there's
                       an invention called television, and
                       on that invention they show shows?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah.

                                  JULES
                       Well, the way they pick the shows
                       on TV is they make one show, and
                       that show's called a pilot.  And
                       they show that one show to the
                       people who pick the shows, and on
                       the strength of that one show, they
                       decide if they want to make more
                       shows.  Some get accepted and
                       become TV programs, and some don't,
                       and become nothing.  She starred in
                       one of the ones that became
                       nothing.

        They enter the apartment building.
