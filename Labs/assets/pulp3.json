3.      INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) - MORNING                                    3.

        The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
        inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
        them.

                                  JULES
                       We should have shotguns for this
                       kind of deal.

                                  VINCENT
                       How many up there?

                                  JULES
                       Three or four.

                                  VINCENT
                       Counting our guy?

                                  JULES
                       I'm not sure.

                                  VINCENT
                       So there could be five guys up
                       there?

                                  JULES
                       It's possible.

                                  VINCENT
                       We should have fuckin' shotguns.

        They CLOSE the trunk.
