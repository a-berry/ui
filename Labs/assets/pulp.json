	INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING                               2.

        An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down
        a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood.  In the front seat are
        two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap
        black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters.
        Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD
        (black).  Jules is behind the wheel.

                                  JULES
                       -- okay now, tell me about the hash
                       bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       What so you want to know?

                                  JULES
                       Well, hash is legal there, right?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
                       hundred percent legal.  I mean you
                       can't walk into a restaurant, roll
                       a joint, and start puffin' away.
                       You're only supposed to smoke in
                       your home or certain designated
                       places.

                                  JULES
                       Those are hash bars?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah, it breaks down like this:
                       it's legal to buy it, it's legal to
                       own it and, if you're the
                       proprietor of a hash bar, it's
                       legal to sell it.  It's legal to
                       carry it, which doesn't really
                       matter 'cause -- get a load of this
                       -- if the cops stop you, it's
                       illegal for this to search you.
                       Searching you is a right that the
                       cops in Amsterdam don't have.

                                  JULES
                       That did it, man -- I'm fuckin'
                       goin', that's all there is to it.

                                  VINCENT
                       You'll dig it the most.  But you
                       know what the funniest thing about
                       Europe is?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       It's the little differences.  A
                       lotta the same shit we got here,
                       they got there, but there they're a
                       little different.

                                  JULES
                       Examples?

                                  VINCENT
                       Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy
                       beer in a movie theatre.  And I
                       don't mean in a paper cup either.
                       They give you a glass of beer, like
                       in a bar.  In Paris, you can buy
                       beer at MacDonald's.  Also, you
                       know what they call a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

                                  JULES
                       They don't call it a Quarter
                       Pounder with Cheese?

                                  VINCENT
                       No, they got the metric system
                       there, they wouldn't know what the
                       fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

                                  JULES
                       What'd they call it?

                                  VINCENT
                       Royale with Cheese.

                                  JULES
                            (repeating)
                       Royale with Cheese.  What'd they
                       call a Big Mac?

                                  VINCENT
                       Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call
                       it Le Big Mac.

                                  JULES
                       What do they call a Whopper?

                                  VINCENT
                       I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger
                       King.  But you know what they put
                       on french fries in Holland instead
                       of ketchup?

                                  JULES
                       What?

                                  VINCENT
                       Mayonnaise.

                                  JULES
                       Goddamn!

                                  VINCENT
                       I seen 'em do it.  And I don't mean
                       a little bit on the side of the
                       plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in
                       it.

                                  JULES
                       Uuccch!

                                                        CUT TO:

3.      INT. CHEVY (TRUNK) - MORNING                                    3.

        The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach
        inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking
        them.

                                  JULES
                       We should have shotguns for this
                       kind of deal.

                                  VINCENT
                       How many up there?

                                  JULES
                       Three or four.

                                  VINCENT
                       Counting our guy?

                                  JULES
                       I'm not sure.

                                  VINCENT
                       So there could be five guys up
                       there?

                                  JULES
                       It's possible.

                                  VINCENT
                       We should have fuckin' shotguns.

        They CLOSE the trunk.

                                                        CUT TO:

4.      EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - MORNING                     4.

        Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically
        dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what
        looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

        We TRACK alongside.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's her name?

                                  JULES
                       Mia.

                                  VINCENT
                       How did Marsellus and her meet?

                                  JULES
                       I dunno, however people meet
                       people.  She usta be an actress.

                                  VINCENT
                       She ever do anything I woulda saw?

                                  JULES
                       I think her biggest deal was she
                       starred in a pilot.

                                  VINCENT
                       What's a pilot?

                                  JULES
                       Well, you know the shows on TV?

                                  VINCENT
                       I don't watch TV.

                                  JULES
                       Yes, but you're aware that there's
                       an invention called television, and
                       on that invention they show shows?

                                  VINCENT
                       Yeah.

                                  JULES
                       Well, the way they pick the shows
                       on TV is they make one show, and
                       that show's called a pilot.  And
                       they show that one show to the
                       people who pick the shows, and on
                       the strength of that one show, they
                       decide if they want to make more
                       shows.  Some get accepted and
                       become TV programs, and some don't,
                       and become nothing.  She starred in
                       one of the ones that became
                       nothing.

        They enter the apartment building.
